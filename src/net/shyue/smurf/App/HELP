SMURF Molecule Reader and Fiddler (SMURF).
Version 1.0

This is a programme written in Java to interprete and manipulate commonly used
molecule file formats.  Currently supported file types include Gaussian 03 input
files (.com), xyz files (.xyz) and generic Z-Matrix specification files (any
extension other than .com and .xyz).

Usage:
-help (display this help message.)
-convert input_file output_file (Convert input file to output file.
 File formats are automatically determined from file extensions.)
-rotate=atom1,atom2,angle (Rotate molecule by angle (in integral degrees) about 
 bond between atom1 and atom2)
-symmetry file1 file2 ... (Get the point group and symmetry information on 
 supplied files)
-ht (-sub=substitutee) (-subwith=substituent) filename (Generates test structures for based on substitution
 of distinct hydrogens with substitutent.  Valid options are CH3 or atomic symbols.
-ext=atom_index filename (Generates extensions of the molecule based on substitution 
 of distinct hydrogens bonded to atom at atom_index.  Only heavy atoms are allowed.
-coord filename1 (Show representations of input files in format defined by format tag.  
 Defaults to listing of cartesian coordinates.)
-network filename1 (Provides listing of connected atoms)

Other options (*) is the default:
-format=zmat|(xyz)|gaussian (Specifies format for output files)
